    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A cookie is a baked or cooked food that is typically small, flat and sweet. It usually contains flour, sugar and some type of oil or fat. It may include other ingredients such as raisins, oats, chocolate chips, nuts, etc.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature</li>
        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed light-brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet and/or milk chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. In a small bowl, whisk together the flour and baking soda; set aside. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter with both sugars; beat on medium speed until light and fluffy. Reduce speed to low; add the salt, vanilla, and eggs. Beat until well mixed, about 1 minute. Add flour mixture; mix until just combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Drop heaping tablespoon-size balls of dough about 2 inches apart on baking sheets lined with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Bake until cookies are golden around the edges, but still soft in the center, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven, and let cool on baking sheet 1 to 2 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack, and let cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature up to 1 week.</li>
    </ol>
